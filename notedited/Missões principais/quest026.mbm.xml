    <source>I got a signal from a deep-voiced guy called Tayama,{F801}from the Ashura-kai. You're supposed to go to {F804,5}Club{F801}Milton{F804,0} in {F804,5}Shibuya,{F804,0} right? Apparently you need to{F801}{F804,5}meet with one of his "boys"{F804,0} there. I've heard of{F801}Club Milton before, but the data I had on it was{F801}corrupted. Sorry, but you'll have to find it on{F801}your own, Master {F843,0}.{F801}</source>
